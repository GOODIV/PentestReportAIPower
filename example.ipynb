      "The text describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found on the website https://test.org. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted post packet, where the title field is manipulated with a specific string of code. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additional Information:\n",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing user data, session hijacking, defacement of websites, and distribution of malware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Estimation:\n",
      "According to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the risk of an XSS vulnerability can vary depending on several factors, including the potential impact on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, XSS vulnerabilities are generally considered medium to high risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding Description:\n",
      "The website https://test.org has an XSS vulnerability that can be exploited by sending a specially crafted post packet. By manipulating the title field with a specific string of code (\"cakemonster=' + escape(document.cookie);\"), an attacker can execute malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft or other harmful activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to Fix:\n",
      "To fix this XSS vulnerability, the website should implement proper input validation and sanitization. This includes encoding or escaping special characters and filtering out potentially harmful code. Additionally, the website should implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be executed in the user's browser. Regular security audits and penetration testing can also help identify and fix potential vulnerabilities.\n"
